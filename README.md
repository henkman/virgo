the nerds can build it with

        git clone https://github.com/papplampe/virgo.git
        cd virgo
        make

If you do not have gcc/make installed you can change that doing following

1. go to http://msys2.github.io/ and install it according to the instructions there
2. open msys2 shell and install mingw-w64-i686-gcc and mingw-w64-i686-make using pacman
3. duplicate C:\msys32\mingw32\bin\mingw32-make.exe and name it make.exe
